Just wanted to see how likely it is that Ferrari wins F1 after initial poor results in the 2025 season.

Turns out that if we just base our analysis on historical data, i.e., from the start of the competition in 1950, we find that if a given driver isn't in the top 3 positions in the standings after the first 3 races, the probability of winning the F1 championship drops enormously: it's **just 16%** (roughly).
